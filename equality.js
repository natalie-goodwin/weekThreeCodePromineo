/*Assignment, Equality, and Identity Operators */

/*Assignment = assigns a value to a variable*/

/*Equality == implicitly converts types to see 
if there is a match; it will say that 2 
and '2'are true even thought they are 
separate types*/

/*Identity -- Strict Equality ===  only returns 
true if their 
operands are the same value and the same type; 
use this as a rule, and only equality operator 
as exceptional need*/

console.log(2 == '2'); /*Equality operator*/
console.log(2 === '2');/*Identity Operator*/
